#### _Context_
_This is a professional development project I made up for myself to practice technical writing. In this project, I create how-to documentation for one of my favorite board games, Azul. The objectives of the project are to demonstrate technical writing skills, fluency in Markdown, and do something fun._

2. Place the factory displays in a circle at the center of the table:
 * 2 players: 5 factory displays
 * 5 players: 7 factory displays
 * 4 players: 9 factory displays
3. Fill the bag with 100 tiles (20 of each color)
4. Draw 4 tiles for each factory display.

### Taking a Turn
1. The last player to visit Portugal takes the starting player marker.
2. **Pick tiles:** Choose all tiles of one color from a factory display or the center. Move any remaining tiles from that factory to the center.
3. **Place tiles:** Add the tiles to a pattern line on your board.
   - Each row holds only one color.
   - Extra tiles that donâ€™t fit go to the floor line and cost points.
4. **End round:** When all tiles are taken, move completed pattern lines to the wall and score points.

### Scoring
- **Single tile:** 1 point.
- **Adjacent tiles:** Gain points for connected horizontal and vertical tiles.
- **Bonus points:**
   - 2 points for each completed row.
   - 7 points for each completed column.
   - 10 points for completing all 5 tiles of one color.
- **Penalties:** Lose points for tiles in the floor line.

### Example Turn
1. You pick 2 blue tiles from a factory display.
2. You place them in the third pattern line.
3. The next player picks tiles.
4. At the end of the round, you move the completed rowâ€™s rightmost tile to the wall and score points.

## Strategies for Winning
- **Plan ahead:** Choose tiles that help you in future rounds.
- **Control the center:** Force opponents to take penalties.
- **Deny opponents:** Take tiles they need.
- **Maximize bonuses:** Focus on rows, columns, and color completion.
- **Avoid penalties:** Minimize tiles in the floor line.

The game ends when a player completes a horizontal row of 5 tiles. The player with the most points wins.

Now youâ€™re ready to play Azul! Have fun creating stunning tile patterns and outscoring your opponents.
